# ⚛️ React Comeback — 10-Day React Developer Revival Journey

> A personal full-stack learning sprint to rebuild my React fundamentals, modern tooling skills, and project portfolio after a career break.

---

## 🚀 Overview
**React Comeback** is a structured 10-day roadmap I created to refresh and advance my React development skills through progressive, real-world projects.

Each day focuses on a specific concept — starting from modern JavaScript and React fundamentals, through routing, state management, API integration, and deployment.  
The final milestone is a fully functional **Ticket Tracker** app built with **React Query** and **Context API**, following industry-ready architecture.
