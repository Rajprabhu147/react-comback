# ⚛️ React Comeback — 10-Day React Developer Revival Journey

> A personal full-stack learning sprint to rebuild my React fundamentals, modern tooling skills, and project portfolio after a career break.

---

## 🚀 Overview
**React Comeback** is a structured 10-day roadmap I created to refresh and advance my React development skills through progressive, real-world projects.

Each day focuses on a specific concept — starting from modern JavaScript and React fundamentals, through routing, state management, API integration, and deployment.  
The final milestone is a fully functional **Ticket Tracker** app built with **React Query** and **Context API**, following industry-ready architecture.

## 🧩 Current Project: **Ticket Tracker (Day 5)**
A real-world-style project that simulates a lightweight issue tracker system.

**Tech Highlights**
- ⚛️ React 18 + Vite (fast dev environment)
- 🎯 React Query (server state, caching, mutations)
- 🧠 Context API (global theme state)
- 💾 JSONPlaceholder API (mock backend)
- 💡 Optimistic UI updates & cache invalidation
- 🎨 Light/Dark theme toggle
- 🧱 Clean, modular architecture

=======
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
